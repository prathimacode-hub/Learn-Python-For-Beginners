<h2> 📌Repository</h2>

This repository helps you in gaining the basic knowledge of Python3 programming in a simplified way. 

I have put up the tutorials covering up the well needed topics to learn Python easily without any hurdles.

You can get all the skills here to start exploring your very own python projects.

Do check this out and if you find any bug or you got to suggest or add up something, don't hesitate to raise an issue.


<h2> 🙌Join Here</h2>

Anyone related to technology who are looking to contribute to open-source, are all invited to hop in. This place has task for everyone.

If you find this repo useful or it did help you in learning python, do share it with the world so that others can get benefitted as you did.  

Drop me a private message if you want to let me know of your progress in learning or to share your projects you had built. I would be happy to assist you or look over your tots coming up live.

To make you familiarize with how programming works in python with proper structuring and algorithms, here I present a [PyAlgo-Tree](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/PyAlgo-Tree) project specifically for contributors who wants to explore and practice their concepts.

To make your learning turn dwelve into real time, I had created an open source project of [Awesome Python Scripts](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts). Do add your projects to enhance your learning experience. It has everything to offer for you and is a one stop place for all kinds of python scripts.

<!-- To check on to my personal compilation of python projects, you can visit the project of [Pythonista For All](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Pythonista_ForAll/) -->

Keep Learning! Keep Growing!

I would be glad to see you mention this repository, if it's the reason that made you contribute your python scripts or algorithms.
